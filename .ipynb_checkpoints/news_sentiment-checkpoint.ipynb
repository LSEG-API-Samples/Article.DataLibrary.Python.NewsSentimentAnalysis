    "# Introduction to News Sentiment Analysis with Data Library for Python - a Python example\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Last Updated**: July 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will demonstrate how we can conduct a simple sentiment analysis of news delivered via our strategic [Data Library for Python](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/lseg-data-platform/lseg-data-library-for-python) (Data Library version 2, aka LSEG Data Library). Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a big area of interest for those looking to gain insight and new sources of value from the vast quantities of unstructured data out there. The area is quite complex and there are many resources online that can help you familiarize yourself with this very interesting area. There are also many different packages that can help you as well as many different approaches to this problem. Whilst these are beyond the scope of this article - I will go through a simple implementation which will give you a swift enough introduction and practical codebase for further exploration and learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "[LSEG Workspace](https://www.lseg.com/en/data-analytics/products/workspace) with access to [Data Library for Python](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/lseg-data-platform/lseg-data-library-for-python).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python 3.10 and above**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Python Packages:** [Data Library for Python](https://pypi.org/project/lseg-data/), jupyterlab, pandas, numpy, beautifulsoup, textblob, datetime, lxml (see more detail on a ```requirements.txt``` file).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required corpora download:** >>> ```python -m textblob.download_corpora``` (this is required by the sentiment engine to generate sentiment)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is a field which enables computers to understand human language (voice or text). This is quite a big area of research and a little enquiry on your part will furnish you with the complexities of this problem set. Here we will be focussing on one application of this called *Sentiment Analysis*. In our case we will be taking news articles(unstructured text) for a particular company, **IBM**, and we will attempt to grade this news to see how positive, negative or neutral it is. We will then try to see if this news has had an impact on the share-price of **IBM**. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this really well is a non-trivial task, and most universities and financial companies will have departments and teams looking at this. We ourselves provide machine readable news products with News Analytics (such as sentiment) over our **Elektron** platform in realtime at very low latency - these products are essentially consumed by *algorithmic applications* as opposed to *humans*. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to do a similar thing as simply as possible to illustrate the key elements - our task is significantly eased by not having to do this in a low latency environment. We will be abstracting most of the complexities to do with the mechanics of actually analyzing the text to various packages. You can then easily replace the modules such as the sentiment engine etc to improve your results as your understanding increases.  "

    "The [Data Library for Python](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/lseg-data-platform/lseg-data-library-for-python) provides a set of ease-of-use interfaces offering coders uniform access to the breadth and depth of financial data and services available on the Workspace, RDP, and Real-Time Platforms. The API is designed to provide consistent access through multiple access channels and target both Professional Developers and Financial Coders. Developers can choose to access content from the desktop, through their deployed streaming services, or directly to the cloud. With the Data Library, the same Python code can be used to retrieve data regardless of which access point you choose to connect to the platform.\n",

So for news generated outside normal market hours for **IBM** in our case, we would have to wait until the next market opening to conduct our calculations. Of course there are a number of issues here concerning our ability to attribute price movement to our news item in isolation (basically we cannot). That said, there might be other ways of doing this - for example looking at **GDRs/ADRs** or surrogates etc - these are beyond the scope of this introductory article. In our example, these news items are simply discarded. \n",

    "From our initial results - it would appear that there might be some small directional differences in returns between the positive and neutral groups over shorter time frames (twoM and fiveM) after news broke. This is a pretty good basis for further investigation. So where could we go from here?\n",

    "In terms of capturing news impact - we have thrown a lot of news articles out as they happened outside of market hours - as it is more complex to ascertain impact - we might try to find a way of including some of this in our analysis - I mentioned looking at overseas listings **GDR/ADRs** or surrogates above. Alternatively, we could using **EXACTLY** the same process looking at all news for an index future - say the **S&P500 emini** - as this trades on Globex pretty much round the clock - so we would be throwing out a lot less of the news articles? Great I hear you cry - but would each news article be able to influence a whole index? Are index futures more sensitive to some types of articles than others? Is there a temporal element to this? These are all excellent questions. Or what about cryptocurrencies? They trade 24/7? and so on.\n",
    "\n",

I hope to have de-mystified this area for you somewhat and shown how it is possible to get started with this type of complex analysis using only a few lines of code, a simple easy to use yet powerful API and some really fantastic packages, to generate some meaningful results."
